1. WORKING WITH URLS
    base URL where our website homepage starts or, server hosts a page.
    After each slash "/" follows url path 
    Some page OPENS with many urls path and some just with single variable path after base url
    IF
        same urls are there in website then first match in url pattern list will be called
        So, they should be differentiated by additional url variable 
        Now each same url will be will not get to first match but same one with additional url will render their specific page and,
        another same url without or with different additional url on left side will route to it's specific page

2. url with get request that returns and re-enters same url
        - example: login form for user to get login user does get request to server
        - server renders form where user fill and submit 
        - sumbit re-enters same url but this time does POST request to server.
        - then same function called again in view.

3. one eg:
    login using admin goes to redirect('admin/')
    before admin theres no slash'/' it means it whatever current path is redirect path will be added
    and request as it.
    if we want redirect or link in redirect is immediately after index page url then 
    slash addition required at front redirect(' /admin/ ')
